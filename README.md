# InternationalPhoneMask

International mask for entering a phone number. Includes 201 countries with unique mask and phone number prefix + country flag.

Simple setup, all you need to do is create an input tag and specify the id of the element. For example:

```html
<input id="phone" />
```

And in the scripts you need to create an instance of the InternationalPhoneMask class:

```ts
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  new InternationalPhoneMask('phone');
});
```

- At the moment the source code of the script is [here](https://github.com/StarkElessar/international-phone-number/tree/master/src/scripts/international-phone-number)
